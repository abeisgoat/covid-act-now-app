          "Covid Act Now was started by four volunteers who saw the explosive and deadly growth of COVID infections around the world and felt they had to do something. The Covid Act Now team has partnered with some of America’s preeminent epidemiologists and data scientists to develop the U.S. Intervention Model.",
          "The U.S. Intervention Model is a data platform that projects COVID infections, hospitalizations, and deaths across the United States, as well as model how public health interventions contain the spread of COVID. We help decision makers understand when and how COVID will affect their communities in order to make better decisions that save lives.",
          "Our U.S. Intervention Model is being used at every level of government across the U.S., the military, private sector, and more. The model has also been used by several countries around the world, including India."
