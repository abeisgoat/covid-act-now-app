        "title": "What is Covid Act Now?",
        "children": "Covid Act Now was started by four volunteers who saw the explosive and deadly growth of COVID infections around the world and felt they had to do something. The Covid Act Now team has partnered with some of America’s preeminent epidemiologists and data scientists to develop the U.S. Intervention Model.\n\nThe U.S. Intervention Model is a data platform that projects COVID infections, hospitalizations, and deaths across the United States, as well as model how public health interventions contain the spread of COVID. We help decision makers understand when and how COVID will affect their communities in order to make better decisions that save lives.\n\nOur U.S. Intervention Model is being used at every level of government across the U.S., the military, private sector, and more. The model has also been used by several countries around the world, including India."

Variables will change.\n*   R0s ([R0 is a fundamental epidemiological metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number)) for interventions are guesses, in some cases informed by data. There is no historical precedent for what is going on right now to draw from.\n*   The default R0 used in this model is an average. The model does not adjust for the population density, culturally-determined interaction frequency and closeness, humidity, etc. in calculating R0.\n*   This is not a node-based analysis and thus assumes everyone spreads the disease at the same rate. In practice, there are some folks who are “super-spreaders,” and others who are almost isolated. Interventions should be targeted primarily at those most likely to spread the disease.\n*   Only hospital beds in aggregate are considered. ICU beds and ventilators, which are likely to run low before beds, are not considered.\n*   Demographics, populations, and hospital bed count data are outdated. Demographics for the U.S. as a whole are used, rather than specific to each state.\n*   In containment cases, we do not consider the longer-term impacts of maintaining containment; primarily, the reintroduction of COVID through travel. 14-day mandatory border quarantines, such as those currently in place in China, would likely need to be implemented until a vaccine or therapeutic is developed."
